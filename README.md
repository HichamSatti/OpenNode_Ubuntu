# OpenNode Nodal Neutron Diffusion code 

In this project we develop a package OpenNode to Solve the multigroup Neutron Diffusion equation using the Nodal methods in 3D Cartesian geometries under Steady-State and Transient conditions

Neutron Diffusion Package OpenNode(Open Neutron Diffusion Package from the Radiations and Nuclear Systems Group), is an open-source code written in FORTRAN90 for a pedagogical purpose to solve the steady-state and transient multigroup neutron diffusion equation using:

* Nodal Expansion Method (NEM) in two- and three-Dimensional for Cartesian geoemtry.
The code, including the graphical user interface is developed and maintained by Hicham SATTI (PhD student) from University Abdelmalek Essaadi Tetouan Morocco .

The directory structure of OpenNode
=============

        cd OpenNode_Ubuntu

This directory contains two folders Docs (documentation) and src (the program source files)

        cd OpenNode_Ubuntu/app/Sources

This directory contains OpenNode source files written in FORTRAN90 such as:
* NEM.F90 (for the Nodal Expansion Method in 2D and 3D)
        cd OpenNode_Ubuntu

This directory contains the modules generated by f2py3 namely NEM.so which will be imported by python3 as modules.

        cd OpenNode_Ubuntu

This directory contains the python3 files for Graphical User Interface (GUI)


Quick Install Guide
=============

This quick install guide outlines the basic steps needed to install OpenNode on your computer.

Installing on Linux
-------------------

1. If you are using Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS, open a terminal in a GNU/Linux box then install gfortran with the following commands:

        sudo apt-get install gfortran

2. You need to install numpy (F2PY) and matplotlib library to run the package OpenNode:

        sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
        sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib

3. You need to install PyQt5 on Ubuntu with python to run the GUI:

        sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

4. You need to install Blender with the following command:

        sudo apt install blender

5. Install the OpenNode package

        git clone  https://github.com/HichamSatti/OpenNode_Ubuntu.git

6. Import the *OpenNode* and run the package in the following way:
    
         cd OpenNode_Ubuntu
         $ python3 GUI.py

Dependencies:
* python (>=3.12.3)
* numpy (>=1.26.4)
* matplotlib (>=3.6.3)
